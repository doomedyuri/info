Howdy!! My name's Kris, or you can call me by whatever character I'm playing as. If you want to know more about me, feel free to check out my rentry!

- I'm not usually tabbed in. So unless you see me actively moving or talking to someone, I'm probably afk. Feel free to whisper me to get my attention or leave me a message and I'll reply to you ASAP!!!

- C+H friendly!! I love when people cuddle and interact with my horse, feel free to do so at any time! Just keep in mind I may forget I have ponytown open and get afk kicked.. Or I may just leave without warning. Otherwise go ahead! ^_^

- If you think my ponies are worthy of inspiration, feel free to take it!! And if you really want to try to copy it 1 to 1, go ahead. It'd be pretty funny to run into a clone of myself one day.
